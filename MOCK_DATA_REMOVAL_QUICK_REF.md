# Quick Reference: Mock Data Removal

## ✅ What Was Done

Removed all mock data from frontend pages and replaced with real API calls to the backend database.

## 📁 Files Changed

| File | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `Dashboard.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Fetches applications, recommendations, courses from API |
| `Feed.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Fetches feed posts and communities from API |
| `CommunitiesPage.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Fetches communities from API + join/leave functionality |
| `Jobs.tsx` | ✅ Ready | Prepared for API integration (using job state) |
| `Skills.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Fetches courses from API |
| `Community.tsx` | ⚠️ Optional | Left with mock data (simple showcase page) |

## 🔌 API Endpoints Now Used

```typescript
// Dashboard
GET /api/dashboard/applications
GET /api/dashboard/recommendations
GET /api/dashboard/courses

// Feed
GET /api/feed?type={filter}
GET /api/communities/my

// Communities
GET /api/communities?type={filter}&search={query}
POST /api/communities/:id/join
POST /api/communities/:id/leave
```

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start backend:** `cd backend && npm start`
2. **Start frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Register/Login:** Create account and verify OTP
