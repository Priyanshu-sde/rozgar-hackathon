# Recruiter Profile View Implementation

## Overview
The Profile page (`/profile`) now intelligently detects if the logged-in user is a recruiter and displays their company profile instead of the job seeker profile.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `frontend/src/pages/Profile.tsx`

#### Added Recruiter Detection
```typescript
// Check if user is a recruiter
const isRecruiter = user?.role === "recruiter";

// Recruiter profile state
const [recruiterProfile, setRecruiterProfile] = useState<any>(null);
const [loadingRecruiterProfile, setLoadingRecruiterProfile] = useState(false);
```

#### Added Recruiter Profile Fetching
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchRecruiterProfile = async () => {
    if (isRecruiter) {
      // Fetch recruiter profile from API
      const response = await axios.get(API_ENDPOINTS.RECRUITER_PROFILE, {...});
      if (response.data.success) {
        setRecruiterProfile(response.data.data);
        setProfileCompletion(response.data.data.profileCompletion || 0);
      }
    }
  };
  fetchRecruiterProfile();
}, [isRecruiter]);
```

#### Added Conditional Rendering
The page now shows different views based on user role:
- **Recruiters** â†’ Company profile view
- **Job Seekers** â†’ Personal profile view (existing)

### 2. Recruiter Profile View Components

#### Profile Completion Card
- Visual progress bar showing profile completion percentage
- Matches the recruiter schema calculation

#### Company Information Card
Displays:
- Company Name
- Industry
- Company Size
- Company Type
- Established Year
- Number of Employees
- Company Description
- Website (with link)
- Email

#### Location Card
Shows complete address:
- Street Address
- City, State, Country, Pincode

#### Currently Hiring For Card
Lists all active hiring positions with:
- Role name
- Number of positions
- Experience required
- Required skills (as badges)

#### Company Benefits Card
Displays all benefits as badges with checkmark icons

#### Social Media Card
Shows links to:
- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- Facebook
- Instagram

#### Edit Button
- Prominent "Edit Profile" button in the company information card
- Redirects to `/recruiter/profile` for editing

#### Empty State
If no profile exists:
- Shows friendly message
- "Create Company Profile" button
- Redirects to `/recruiter/profile`

### 3. Updated `frontend/src/pages/RecruiterProfile.tsx`

Changed the redirect after saving:
```typescript
// Redirect to profile view page after successful save
setTimeout(() => {
  navigate("/profile");
}, 1500);
```

**Before:** Redirected to `/dashboard`
**After:** Redirects to `/profile` (view mode)
