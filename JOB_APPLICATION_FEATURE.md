# Job Application Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Implemented full job application functionality for both recruiter-posted and AI-sourced jobs, allowing users to apply and recruiters to view applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Components Created

  - Full application form with cover letter
  - Expected salary input
  - Application priority selection (low/medium/high)
  - Personal notes field
  - Saves application to database
  - Prevents duplicate applications
  
- **For AI-Sourced Jobs**:
  - Simplified modal
  - Information display
  - Redirects to external job posting (Indeed)
  - Opens in new tab

**Fields**:
- Cover Letter (optional, 1000 char limit with counter)
- Expected Salary (optional)
- Priority (low/medium/high)
- Notes (optional)

#### B. JobDetailsModal Component (`/frontend/src/components/JobDetailsModal.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Display complete job information before applying

**Features**:
- Full job description
- Quick info grid (location, type, mode, salary, experience, openings)
- Required skills display
- Category and posted date
- Apply now button (opens ApplyJobModal)
- For AI jobs: "Visit Source" button to open external link

**Information Displayed**:

### 2. Frontend Updates

#### Jobs Page (`/frontend/src/pages/Jobs.tsx`)

**Added Imports**:
```typescript
import { ApplyJobModal } from "@/components/ApplyJobModal";
import { JobDetailsModal } from "@/components/JobDetailsModal";
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
```

**New State Variables**:
```typescript
const [showApplyModal, setShowApplyModal] = useState(false);
const [showDetailsModal, setShowDetailsModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedJob, setSelectedJob] = useState<Job | null>(null);
```

**New Handler Functions**:
- `handleApplyClick(job)` - Opens apply modal for selected job
- `handleViewDetails(job)` - Opens details modal for selected job
- `handleApplicationSuccess()` - Shows success toast after application

**Button Updates**:
- "Apply Now" button → Calls `handleApplyClick(job)`
- "View Details" button → Calls `handleViewDetails(job)`

**Modal Integration**:
- ApplyJobModal renders at bottom of component
- JobDetailsModal renders at bottom of component
- Both pass required props and handlers

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Updated `/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`:
```typescript
APPLICATION_CREATE: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/applications`,
```

### 4. Backend Routes (Already Existing)

The backend already has full job application support in `/backend/routes/applications.js`:

#### Create Application: `POST /api/applications`
**Request Body**:
```javascript
{
  jobPostId: string,          // Optional - for recruiter jobs
  jobTitle: string,           // Required
  company: string,            // Required
  location: string,           // Required
  salary: string,             // Optional
  jobType: string,            // Required (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.)
  applicationMethod: string,  // Default: 'platform'
  applicationUrl: string,     // Optional
  coverLetter: string,        // Optional
  notes: string,              // Optional
  recruiterContact: object,   // Optional
  expectedSalary: string,     // Optional
  priority: string            // Default: 'medium'
}
```

**Response**:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  message: 'Application submitted successfully',
  data: {
    id: applicationId,
    jobTitle, company, location,
    status: 'applied',
    appliedDate, ...
  }
}
```

**Features**:
- Prevents duplicate applications (checks existing)
- Creates application with status 'applied'
- Stores all application details
- Links to job post if available

#### Get Recruiter Applicants: `GET /api/recruiter/jobs/:jobId/applicants`
**Purpose**: Recruiters can see who applied to their jobs

**Response**:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: [
    {
      _id: applicantId,
      user: { name, email, profile },
      status: 'pending',
      coverLetter, resume,
      appliedAt, ...
    }
  ]
}
```
