## âœ… Status: Implementation Complete

All backend endpoints required by the frontend have been implemented and are ready for testing.

**Next Step:** Start both servers and test the application end-to-end.

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Backend
cd backend && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start Frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser and test the functionality.
