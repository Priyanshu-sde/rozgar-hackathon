# Community and Post Functionality Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to the community and post functionality.

## 1. Backend Changes

### A. Multiple Community Post Support (`backend/routes/feed.js`)
- **Modified**: `POST /api/feed/posts` endpoint
- **Changes**:
  - Now supports posting to multiple communities at once
  - Accepts both `communityId` (single) and `communityIds` (array) parameters
  - Creates a separate post instance for each selected community
  - Validates that user is a member of all selected communities before posting
  - Returns array of created posts when posting to multiple communities

### B. Safety Checks Added

#### `backend/models/User.js`
- Fixed `skillsCount` virtual field to handle undefined/null skills array
- Added safety check: `return this.skills && Array.isArray(this.skills) ? this.skills.length : 0;`

#### `backend/models/Community.js`
- Fixed `isMember` method with proper null/undefined checks
- Fixed `isAdmin` method with proper null/undefined checks
- Prevents crashes when members array or user fields are undefined

### C. Existing Routes (Already Working)
- `GET /api/communities/:id` - Get community details
- `GET /api/communities/:id/posts` - Get community posts
- `GET /api/communities/:id/members` - Get community members
- `POST /api/communities/:id/join` - Join a community
- `POST /api/communities/:id/leave` - Leave a community

## 2. Frontend Changes

### A. Create Post Modal (`frontend/src/components/CreatePostModal.tsx`)
- **Enhanced with Multiple Community Selection**:
  - Fetches user's joined communities on modal open
  - Displays checkboxes for each community the user has joined
  - Allows selecting multiple communities to post to
  - Shows selected communities as removable badges
  - Pre-selects community if `communityId` prop is provided
  - Validates that at least one community is selected
  - Sends `communityIds` array to backend

**New Features**:
- Multi-select community interface with checkboxes
- Visual feedback showing selected communities as badges
- Option to remove selected communities (except pre-selected one)
- Empty state when user hasn't joined any communities

### B. Community Page (`frontend/src/pages/CommunityPage.tsx`)
- **Replaced Mock Data with Real API Calls**:
  - `fetchCommunityData()` - Fetches community details from API
  - `fetchCommunityPosts()` - Fetches posts from the community
  - `fetchCommunityMembers()` - Fetches community member list
  - `handleJoinCommunity()` - Real join/leave functionality

**Members Tab Enhancement**:
- Displays all community members with avatars
- Shows member name, location, and skills
- Displays badges for Admin, Moderator, and role
- Shows top 3 skills with "+X more" indicator
- Responsive card layout with hover effects

### C. Token Consistency Fix
Fixed localStorage token key inconsistency across all files:
- Changed from `"token"` to `"rozgar_token"` in:
  - `CreatePostModal.tsx`
  - `CreateCommunityModal.tsx`
  - `CreateJobModal.tsx`
  - `Feed.tsx`
  - `CommunitiesPage.tsx`
  - `Dashboard.tsx`
  - `Skills.tsx`
  - `RecruiterDashboard.tsx`

## 3. How It Works Now

### Creating Posts
1. User clicks "Create New Post" button
2. Modal opens showing all communities user has joined
3. User can select one or multiple communities

   - Posts tab shows all community posts
   - Members tab shows all members with their details
   - Sidebar shows community rules and admins

### Feed Functionality
- Feed shows posts from all communities user has joined
- Each post displays the community it belongs to
- Users can filter posts by type (all, job, course, post, poll)
- Community names are clickable links to community pages

## 4. API Endpoints Used
