## Database Considerations

Currently, the recruiter routes use **mock data**. To make this production-ready:

1. **Create Job Model** (`/backend/models/Job.js`)
   - Fields: title, company, location, type, salary, description, requirements
   - Relationships: recruiterId (User), applicants array

2. **Update JobApplication Model** 
   - Ensure it has: userId, jobId, status, resume, coverLetter, appliedAt

3. **Implement Database Queries**
   - Replace mock data in `/backend/routes/recruiter.js`
   - Connect to Job and JobApplication models

## Testing Checklist
