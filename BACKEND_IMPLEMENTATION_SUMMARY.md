## Files Modified

1. `/backend/routes/applications.js`
   - Added GET endpoints for interviews, followups, and notes

2. `/backend/routes/feed.js`
   - Added POST endpoint for creating posts
   - Added helper function `getAuthorRole()`

3. `/backend/routes/communities.js`
   - Added GET/POST endpoints for community posts
   - Added POST endpoints for liking posts
   - Added GET/POST endpoints for post comments
   - Added helper function `getAuthorRole()`

## API Consistency

All new endpoints follow the existing API patterns:
- Consistent error handling with `success` and `message` fields
- Proper authentication using `authMiddleware`
- Pagination support where applicable
- Input validation for required fields
- Population of related data (author, community, etc.)
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 403, 404, 500)

## Authentication & Authorization

All endpoints are protected with:
- `authMiddleware` - Ensures user is logged in
- Community membership checks - Validates user access to community resources
- Owner checks - Validates user can modify their own applications

## Response Format

All endpoints return consistent JSON responses:
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "message": "Success or error message",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## Next Steps

The backend now fully supports all frontend functionality defined in `/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`. The API endpoints are complete and ready for testing with the frontend application.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all new GET endpoints to ensure proper data retrieval
2. Test POST endpoints with both valid and invalid data
3. Test authentication and authorization for all endpoints
4. Test pagination for endpoints that support it
5. Test error handling for various edge cases
6. Verify community membership validation works correctly
7. Test like toggle functionality (like/unlike)
8. Test comment creation and retrieval

## Port Configuration

The backend server runs on:
- Default: `http://localhost:4000`
- Can be configured via `PORT` environment variable

CORS is configured to allow requests from:
- `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
- `http://localhost:8080`
- `http://localhost:3000`

**Frontend Configuration:**
- A `.env` file has been created in `/frontend/.env` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000`
- This ensures the frontend correctly points to the backend server
