# Fix: Token Authentication Issue

## Problem
User was unable to save changes because the backend middleware was only checking for tokens in cookies, but the frontend was sending tokens in the Authorization header.

## Solution
Updated `backend/middleware/userAuth.js` to check for tokens in **both** places:
1. **Cookies** (for cookie-based auth)
2. **Authorization header** (for token-based auth with Bearer prefix)

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/middleware/userAuth.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const { token } = req.cookies;
if (!token) {
    return res.json({ success: false, message: 'Not Authorized. Login Again' });
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Check for token in cookies OR Authorization header
let token = req.cookies.token;

// If no token in cookies, check Authorization header
if (!token && req.headers.authorization) {
    const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
    if (authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
        token = authHeader.substring(7); // Remove 'Bearer ' prefix
    }
}

if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ 
        success: false, 
        message: 'Not Authorized. Login Again' 
    });
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Frontend Sends Token
```typescript
const token = localStorage.getItem("rozgar_token");
const config = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
};

axios.post(API_ENDPOINTS.RECRUITER_PROFILE, profile, config);
```

### Backend Receives Token
```javascript
1. Check req.cookies.token
2. If not found, check req.headers.authorization
3. Extract token from "Bearer <token>"
4. Verify token with JWT
5. Fetch user from database
6. Attach user info to req.user
7. Continue to next middleware/controller
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Flexible Authentication**: Supports both cookie-based and header-based auth
âœ… **Frontend Compatible**: Works with localStorage tokens
âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Still supports cookie-based auth
âœ… **Better Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes (401)
âœ… **Logging**: Added console logs for debugging

## Testing

### Test if fix works:

1. **Login as recruiter**
2. **Check localStorage** - Verify `rozgar_token` exists
3. **Go to `/recruiter/profile`**
4. **Fill in the form**
5. **Click "Save Changes"**
6. **Check browser console** - Should see:
   ```
   Saving profile data: {...}
   API Response: {success: true, ...}
   ```
7. **Check backend console** - Should see:
   ```
   User authenticated: { id: '...', role: 'recruiter', email: '...' }
   Creating/Updating recruiter profile for user: ...
   ```
8. **Success!** - Profile saved and redirected to /feed

## What Was Wrong

The frontend was sending:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

But the backend was only looking for:
```javascript
req.cookies.token
```

Now the backend checks **both** locations, so it finds the token in the Authorization header.

## Other Improvements Made

1. âœ… Better HTTP status codes (401 instead of 200 with error)
2. âœ… Console logging for authentication
3. âœ… Clearer error messages
4. âœ… User not found handling (404)
5. âœ… Token expiration handling

## Files Modified

- âœ… `backend/middleware/userAuth.js` - Updated authentication logic

## Now It Should Work! ðŸŽ‰

The save functionality will now work properly because:
- âœ… Backend can read token from Authorization header
- âœ… User is properly authenticated
- âœ… Role is verified (recruiter)
- âœ… Profile can be saved to database
- âœ… Success response returned
- âœ… Frontend redirects to /feed
