# Job Application Functionality Implementation

## ✅ Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The Apply and View Job buttons are now fully functional! Here's what has been implemented:

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Apply Now Button**
- ✅ Opens application modal when clicked
- ✅ Different behavior for AI-sourced vs Recruiter-posted jobs
- ✅ Saves applications to database
- ✅ Redirects to external sites for AI jobs

### 2. **View Details Button**
- ✅ Opens detailed job information modal
- ✅ Shows complete job description
- ✅ Displays all job requirements
- ✅ Allows applying directly from details view

## How It Works

### For Recruiter-Posted Jobs

When a user clicks "Apply Now" on a recruiter-posted job:

1. **Application Modal Opens** with form fields:
   - Cover Letter (optional, max 1000 chars)
   - Expected Salary (optional)
   - Application Priority (low/medium/high)
   - Additional Notes (optional)

2. **Form Submission**:
   - Validates user is logged in
   - Checks for duplicate applications
   - Saves to database via API
   - Shows success notification

3. **Backend Processing**:
   - Creates `JobApplication` record
   - Links to user profile
   - Stores application metadata
   - Adds status history entry

4. **Recruiter Access**:
   - Recruiter can view all applicants
   - Access via Recruiter Dashboard
   - See applicant details and status

### For AI-Sourced Jobs

When a user clicks "Apply Now" on an AI-sourced job:

1. **Simplified Modal Opens**:
   - Shows job information
   - Explains external redirect
   - No form fields needed

2. **Redirect Behavior**:
   - Opens external job posting in new tab
   - Uses Indeed search with job title & location
   - User applies on external site
   - Success notification shown

### View Details Modal

Shows comprehensive job information:
- ✅ Job title and company
- ✅ Location, type, and work mode
- ✅ Salary range
- ✅ Experience requirements
- ✅ Number of openings
- ✅ Full job description
- ✅ Required skills (clickable badges)
- ✅ Category and posting date
- ✅ Apply button (opens apply modal)
- ✅ External link for AI jobs

## Components

### 1. Jobs.tsx (`/frontend/src/pages/Jobs.tsx`)

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
// Handle Apply button click
const handleApplyClick = (job) => {
  setSelectedJob(job);
  setShowApplyModal(true);
};

// Handle View Details button click
const handleViewDetails = (job) => {
  setSelectedJob(job);
  setShowDetailsModal(true);
};

// Success callback
const handleApplicationSuccess = () => {
  toast({
    title: "Application submitted!",
    description: selectedJob?.source === "ai" 
      ? "External job posting opened in new tab" 
      : "Your application has been submitted successfully.",
  });
};
```

**Modals Rendered:**
```tsx
<ApplyJobModal
  open={showApplyModal}
  onOpenChange={setShowApplyModal}
  job={selectedJob}
  onSuccess={handleApplicationSuccess}
/>

<JobDetailsModal
  open={showDetailsModal}
  onOpenChange={setShowDetailsModal}
  job={selectedJob}
  onApply={handleApplyClick}
/>
```

### 2. ApplyJobModal.tsx (`/frontend/src/components/ApplyJobModal.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Conditional rendering based on job source (AI vs Recruiter)
- Form validation and error handling
- Character counter for cover letter
- Priority selection dropdown
- Token-based authentication
- API integration with proper error handling

**API Call:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.APPLICATION_CREATE, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(applicationData)
});
```

**External Redirect (AI Jobs):**
```typescript
window.open(
  `https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=${encodeURIComponent(job.title)}&l=${encodeURIComponent(job.location)}`, 
  '_blank'
);
```

### 3. JobDetailsModal.tsx (`/frontend/src/components/JobDetailsModal.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Responsive layout with grid information cards
- Formatted salary display
- Skill badges
- Category and posting date
- Primary CTA: Apply Now button
- Secondary CTA: Visit Source (for AI jobs)
